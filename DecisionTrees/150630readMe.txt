General Usage Notes
-------------------
-Please go into the DeciisionTrees/data_sets1 or data_sets2 for running the corresponding datasets as the input

-Run the code using the below command in the command line
 
Rscript Dtree.R training_set.csv validation_set.csv test_set.csv 

-The program was coded using RStudio

Program Description
-------------------

The analysis of Rpart Package by using the functions rpart, plot, text, prune and predict 
A decision tree is built and pruning is performed using the training data.
Testing data is used to predict the accuracy of the decision trees created.

Observation
-----------

From the output, it can be observed that

Pruning the tree using the minimum xerror values CP doesn't help much and hence the original decision tree and the pruned decision tree are all the same in this case.
In this program, Rpart package from R rpogramming language is used to develop the decision tree.
The parameters used are rpart() to build the tree, prune() to prune the tree and predict() to predict the tree using testing data set.
Plot() and text() functions are used to develop the tree graphically and summary() is used to describe the tree structure obtained.
